# Multifractal Analysis with pymultifracs

This repository contains Jupyter Book tutorials on **multifractal analysis** using the [`pymultifracs`](https://github.com/neurospin/pymultifracs) library. These tutorials introduce the fundamentals of **wavelet-based multifractal analysis**, covering the computation of **p-leaders, log-cumulants, structure functions, and multifractal spectra**.

The **pymultifracs** library was developed by **Merlin Dumeur** and is based on the **Wavelet p-Leader and Bootstrap-based Multifractal analysis (PLBMF) toolbox**, originally created by **Patrice Abry, Herwig Wendt, and colleagues**.

## Tutorial Contents
This series covers:
- **An introduction to wavelet-based multifractal analysis (MFA)**
- **Methods for identifying and handling outliers in multifractal signals**
- **Techniques for analyzing joint multifractal properties between two signals**

Each notebook provides **theoretical foundations, implementation details, and guidance on result interpretation**.
