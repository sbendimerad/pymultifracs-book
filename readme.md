# **Multifractal Analysis with pymultifracs**  

This repository contains tutorials on **wavelet-based multifractal analysis** using the [`pymultifracs`](https://github.com/neurospin/pymultifracs) library. These tutorials provide an introduction to multifractal analysis, including **estimation of multifractal spectra, structure functions, cumulant analysis, and outlier detection**.

## **About pymultifracs**  
[`pymultifracs`](https://github.com/neurospin/pymultifracs) is a Python package developed by **Merlin Dumeur** for performing **wavelet-based multifractal analysis** on 1D signals.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Features of pymultifracs:**
- Computation of **wavelet coefficients, wavelet-leaders, and p-leaders**  
- Estimation of **multifractal spectra**  
- Analysis using **structure functions and log-cumulants**  
- **Bivariate multifractal analysis**  
- **Bootstrap confidence intervals** and **automated scaling range selection**  
- **Outlier detection**  

The implementation is based on the **Wavelet p-Leader and Bootstrap-based Multifractal analysis (PLBMF) toolbox** initially developed in MATLAB by **Patrice Abry, Herwig Wendt, and colleagues**.
